# Organisms

Organisms are much more complex groups of elements and are used to display more complex information than a simple atom or molecule could provide.

Organisms, like Molecules and Atoms should only ever receive data via props and should have no concept of the application state.
They should be completely self-contained and should not depend on any other part of the application other than having access
to the application styles.

For more information on organisms, please [read the documents](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) on the Atomic Design Principle by Brad Frost.
