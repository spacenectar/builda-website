# Molecules

Molecules are a group of UI elements which result in more complex but still very simple components.

Molecules, like Atoms should only ever receive data via props and should have no concept of the application state.
They should be completely self-contained and should not depend on any other part of the application other than having access
to the application styles.

For more information on molecules, please [read the documents](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) on the Atomic Design Principle by Brad Frost.
