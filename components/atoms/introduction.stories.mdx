# Atoms

Atoms are the smallest building blocks of an application. The output of an atom is always a single element.

Atoms should only ever receive data via props and should have no concept of the application state.
They should be completely self-contained and should not depend on any other part of the application other than having access
to the application styles.

For more information on atoms, please [read the documents](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) on the Atomic Design Principle by Brad Frost.
