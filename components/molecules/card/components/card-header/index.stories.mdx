# Card header

The `CardHeader` component is the header section of any component which supports a card like layout (Look for the <WorksWith component="cards" /> badge in the story). It should not be used standalone.

The `CardHeader` adds some spacing and a bottom border to the content within it.

See the [Card](?path=/docs/atom-card--default-story) component docs for more information.
