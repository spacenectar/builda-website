# Builda website

This is the website repository for the [builda](https://builda.app) package.

Feel free to have a look around and contribute to the docs or any other improvements
you think you can make.

> **LOOKING FOR THE `BUILDA` APP?**  
> If you want to install Builda, then it is available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/builda)
> and can be installed using the documentation found at [https://builda.app/docs/installation](https://builda.app/docs/installation).

## Running the website locally

To make changes to the website beyond updating docs or tweaking components in
storybook (see below), you will need to install the project locally via
`yarn install`. Then run the following command:

```bash
 yarn dev
```

> **NOTE:** Before you do this however, you will need the credentials for the
> application. Unless you are an approved contributor to the website, you will need
> to contact the [team](https://builda.app/team) to get these.

## Storybook

If you just want to tweak the website, you can use the storybook to preview the
components that we use and make changes to them (you will still need to run
`yarn install` first).

```bash
 yarn storybook
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the website, you can either fork the repository or
join the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/spacenectar/builda/discussions).
